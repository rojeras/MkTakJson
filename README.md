# bs-json
Generate BS JSON files 

## To consider
* Should I also read NTJP TAKs to figure out what routes there are to TC and COSMIC for the request contracts to be able to remove them. 
    * Should be easy to implement but maybe overkill.
* If we update RTP-TAKs the source of TAK-ings are lost. We cannot generate new files any more. 
    * We need a way to store the RTP TAKs.
    * Save it in files
    * Enought to include the routes to COSMIC and TC from ServiceProductions.
